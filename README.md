The year is 2050 and we finally have the technology to non-invasively read the minds of our pets. This is where Acme Pet comes in. Acme has developed a collar for your pet that once registered you can send your pets thoughts to their servers and understand what activities your pet most enjoys. Conveniently Acme has an online Pet store that uses this data to help recommend items you can purchase to increase your pets happiness. In order to do this they need to create a data product that combines event data directly from your pets brain and join it with their pet registration database. One this is done they will take this data and create another Data Product that will perform Pet Segmentation for future recommendations.
